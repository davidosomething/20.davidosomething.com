## Physical setup

My desk is a 48"x24" [Herman Miller Everywhere Rectangular Table]. I wish
I had gone with the white finish and legs for the table.

A giant [AUKEY mouse pad] covers the top, granting unlimited mouse travel, and
it's much nicer to have a soft surface than to place my wrists on the bare
desktop.

I sit on a comfy padded dining chair and I have no issue with it. The chair
looks better than an office chair since my setup is in the living room.

I have a nice [Poppin file cabinet] that doubles as a second seat.

My old Mac Pro 5,1 serves as a foot rest at the moment.

## Hardware

My primary computer is the [Intel NUC 7i5BNH].

<details>
<summary><strong>How I ended up on a NUC (click to expand)</strong></summary>
I was using a 2010 Mac Pro 5,1 that I bought off an office liquidation
auction in 2016. Apple has dropped it from official Catalina support and
I need a stable system.

I had considered getting a Mac Mini 2018, but decided against it after reading
about Bluetooth and Catalina issues. I ruled out the MacBook Pro 2019 model
because I hate the Touch Bar.

Rather than buy something new, I just re-purposed the NUC, serving as a media
player for my TV. It's already 3 years old, but that's newer than the Mac Pro
I had. Also, <strong>there's Thunderbolt 3</strong> support, so I can
introduce an eGPU and 10GE port in the future.
</details>
<br>

The NUC is outfitted with:

- 32GB RAM, which is just adequate these days
- A 500GB [Samsung 970 EVO NVMe] for the OS + /home
- A 500GB [Samsung 850 EVO SSD] for document storage

For peripherals, I have

- Two monitors on desk clamp mount:
    - An [Acer G257HU] 2560x1440 monitor
    - A Lenovo FHD monitor I got for free, in portrait mode
- An [Apple Magic Keyboard] because I got used to the Apple scissor feel
- A [VicTsing gaming mouse] with silent click so as not to wake the baby
- [Sony MDR7506 headphones] that I never put on my head... I use them as
  terrible speakers even though they're highly praised studio headphones
- Some generic 7 port USB 3.0 powered hub
- A USB 3.0 Anker hard drive docking station to access my old HDDs
- A [Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i] scanner because I scan everything important

Everything plugs in to a [Belkin 8-Outlet surge protector]. The plug shapes
are annoying and block one of the 8 outlets. Wish I had some 3 inch extension
cords.

### Phone

I'm an Android user. I broke my last phone, the amazing LG V30, and now I use
a cheap [Amazon Moto X4]. It's super nice to go midrange over flagship. I will
keep it as long as the GPS can reliably get me from point A to B.

My particular favorite apps are:

- [Nova Launcher Prime]
- [Flamingo for Twitter] though I don't think it's available any more
- [Sync Pro] for reddit
- [AntennaPod] for podcasts since PocketCasts changed too much on me
- [KDE Connect] for integration with my desktop
- [Feedly Classic] you can't "mark page as read" with the same ease in the new
  version
- [Brave] blocks ads and is Chromium-based

### Audio

I use [Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones]. I haven't gone full wireless
because I like having the neck wire to hang them from when I'm not wearing
them.

### Watch

White [Pebble Time] running [rebble] services. I've had two pebbles, both
Kickstarter backer editions. I still consider the Time the best smartwatch.

## Software

[My dotfiles], vimrc, zshrc, and [Chrome extensions] of choice are in GitHub
if that's what you're into.

![My terminal](./assets/terminal-potatonuc.png "My Terminal")

CLI tools I use include:

- [fd] for finding files and directories
- [fzf] for fuzzy finding integrated with git, vim, and my shell
- [ripgrep] for finding and filtering files by contents
- [z.lua] a fast lua implementation if autojump / z
- [zplugin] for managing my zsh plugins

My terminal emulator is Konsole now. Konsole is non-electron, supports
splitting without tmux, 24-bit color, customizable shortcuts and scrollback.
It checks all the boxes for me. Terminator and Termite are my other terminal
choices. I am not using them because they are libvte-based and I wanted to
stay in the KDE world.

### OS

I've distro-hopped from Mojave to [Manjaro] Linux since switching from a Mac
Pro to the NUC. I went with the KDE version because Plasma hooked me. Manjaro
has the benefits of Arch Linux (IMO, primarily pacman and the AUR) without
having to do the setup for the millionth time.

### Editor

I still use [Neovim] having moved from Vim years ago. I follow HEAD since
I prudent enough read the Gitter room and changelogs.

I made my own color scheme called "[meh]." It caters to what I consider
important when looking at code.

My programming font of choice is Mozilla's [Fira Mono].

### Notes

For note-taking, I converted to [Joplin Notes] last year. Joplin is
cross-platform including mobile apps; it has markdown support, tagging, and
end-to-end encrypted syncing. The desktop UI is a bit drab, but customizable
via CSS.

### Password manager

My password manager is [Bitwarden], and I pay for Premium. I moved from
[KeepassXC] to make sharing some passwords easier with my family.

### File sync and backups

I wouldn't be at a loss if I had re-provision with the same settings
and restore my files.

For file syncing and sharing I use Dropbox and Google Drive (e.g. my resume,
avatars, etc.). I always assume that things in those cloud services can go
public at any time. For super private stuff, I have a [Synology NAS] I can
access.

My cloud files and local photos and documents are synced to my NAS. I send
encrypted, incremental snapshots of the synced drive to [Backblaze B2] using
[restic] running in a Docker container.

On the OS-level, I keep my `/etc` backed up using [etckeeper], and push to
a remote git repo as backup.
